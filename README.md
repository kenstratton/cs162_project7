Description of Inheritance, Exceptions, and Polymorphism

## Build A Design

### ▼ Pick a generic object where something could cause exception in its state
### ▼ Describe a generic exception that could happen in your object
### ▼ Describe two subclasses of the object
### ▼ Describe two subclasses of the exception
### ▼ Draw an inheritance diagram (relationships between the classes and the exceptions)
### ▼ Design a program of the planned classes and inheritance diagram showing how inheritance can work

## Implement The Design

### ▼ Classes work properly?
### ▼ Raise, Catch, and Handle Exceptions
### ▼ An inappropriately handled exception crashes your program
### ▼ Print the data in an organized way (Instances are in a given classification?)

## Add Tests

### ▼ Kinds of tests to verify the functionality of the sorting program
### ▼ Test for
